# M훮ori Words

I live in New Zealand/Aotearoa, so I use a lot of M훮ori both for placenames and in my vernacular.

I have structured M훮ori words with one stroke per sylable/[mora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_phonology#Phonotactics) with the exception of long vowels and diphthongs. M훮ori sylables never have a final consonant, so these words are very left-hand heavy. 

Consonants are always as written, so "wh" is stroked "WH-". "ng" is stroked "TKPW-" which is the chord for "g", as "g" never occurs on it own in a word.

Vowels are also as written, with the same chord for both long and short vowels.

| Vowel | Chord |
|-------|-------|
| a     | A     |
| e     | E     |
| i     | EU    |
| o     | O     |
| u     | U     |
| ae    | AE    |
| ai    | AEU   |
| ao    | AO    |
| au    | AU    |
| ou    | OU    |

Any other combinations of vowels are split across separate moras. I have added briefs for the multisylabic affixes "whaka-" and "-tanga", but otherwise have made no effort to condense the length of words or phrases.

Macrons are fingerspelt with "\*P" and "\*RP" (think macRon and macRon uPper case).

I have also made a minimal effort to avoid conflicts with Plover's default dictionaries.

## Vocabulary

The word lists I used are:

I have also included some other words that I hear used frequently. I have omitted single letter words and particles, as they would be identical to the fingerspelling. I have also omitted some words that also appear in the Plover default dictionaries.

Place names are in a separate dictionary. I have also included more place names for Tauranga and Christchurch, as these are the places I have lived.
